<h3 style="text-align: center; color: rgb(248, 95, 166);">Good day! I'm Mhuriel Ann B. Buchan</h3>
<p style="background-color: rgb(252, 190, 208); text-align:left;">I'm a grade 9 student from section Air here at RTPM-DSHS, and I'm thrilled to be part of this passionate community.
    I like watching K-dramas, singing, cooking, and occasionally crocheting in my free time. 
    In school, I have a strong interest in Science, Math, and AP. Whether it's solving challenging math problems, conducting scientific experiments, or diving into economics, I find joy in learning and exploring new ideas.
    I'm looking forward to making the most of my high school experience by having fun despite all of the challenges. I believe that this time in my life is an opportunity for personal growth and building lasting friendships.
