<p class="solid">How Swedish tech entrepreneur Daniel Ek and business partner Martin Lorentzon revolutionized the music industry through free and legal music streaming when they launched Spotify.</p>
<h1 align="center" > Reflection <h1>
    <p>Last Friday, January 5, 2024, in the afternoon, was our ICT class. Sir Cimafranca assigned us to watch the first episode of the series "The Playlist." It's a series about how the most used digital music service nowadays is made, which is "Spotify." Daniel Ek is the CEO and co-founder of Spotify. The first part of the episode was interesting because it shows why Daniel came up with the idea of Spotify. He grew up in Ragsved, created web sites for businesses, and ran web hosting services out of his bedroom. Daniel loves music, but the only problem at that time was that music is not free and it's expensive. There was a website called "Pirate Bay" that offered free music, but there were a lot of ads, and it took a lot of time to download the song in order to play it. Daniel realized that he needs to change the music industry because it's slowly dying. I was so amazed at how he makes his living; he just sold his company for 10 million dollars. And for how Spotify started, he contacted his connections in order to make his visions a reality. Overall, Daniel Ek really did a great job of creating the idea of Spotify because it's now a successful digital music service and it also helps the music industry a lot.</p>
